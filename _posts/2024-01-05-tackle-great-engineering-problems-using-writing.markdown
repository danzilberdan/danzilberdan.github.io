# Introduction
In the fast-paced world of engineering, where everyone's busy doing, the often overlooked skill of writing seems to slip under the radar for many.

In this post I aim to lay out the different roles of writing as a tool in the toolbox of engineers in the journey of solving great engineering problems:
- Thinking
- Defining Processes
- Empathetic Communication
- Knowledge Base (and a word about LLMs)

# Thinking

The first aspect we explore is the role of writing in the thinking process, liberating us from the confines of our memory and guiding us through the paths of problem-solving.

As humans, our inherent instinct of taking the path of least resistance leads us to secure important thoughts in our memory. It is a constant temptation accompanying our mind, whispering to us "just leave that thought here and it will be taken care of". But our memory is unreliable especially when dealing with details.

When trying to solve a great task, we often fall for the same trap. We start to create structure in our memory. But as we develop an idea, the base of the structure starts to fade away. When complex problems are tackled, often times the whole structure cannot fit in our memory at all.

Writing is a cycle of writing and rereading. It allows us to repeatedly scan our ideas and their connections. In each iteration our mind can focus on a certain aspect and "forget" about the rest. More passes will possible expose conflicts with other ideas. As the we go through the cycles, the written result gets better.

In addition, in the process of designing solutions, we encounter many problems that do not have binary rights and wrongs. Our decisions will driven by important factors such as intuition, knowledge, experience and so on. The issue here is that we need to extract the logical factors after filtering out our biases and formalize to ourselves and to others the thinking process that we went through. Writing is the ultimate tool for that.

# Defining Processes

Many times, solving significant problems involves processes which need to be executed many times. For example, the development of hardware requires iterations of prototypes which are built with different assembly steps, firmware compilation and so on.

These kind of processes contain many small details which evolve through practice and time. Usually, the details are spread across the minds of everyone involved in the process. Writing down the details of each stage of the process can optimize the process on the organizational level.

When things go wrong, it often leads to arguments and blame directed towards the person responsible for the error. Having a written process significantly simplifies the handling of these situations. By simply correcting the documented process and ensuring it explicitly addresses the identified problem, the organization can shift its focus to continuous improvement from each iteration as a whole.

Furthermore, newcomers to the organization can swiftly grasp the processes and acclimate themselves, facilitating a quicker adaptation to their roles.

# Empathetic Communication

When making decisions as a team, not everyone agrees on the direction taken. The best we can do about it is to allow everyone to feel like they have been listened to and that their opinion was taken seriously.

Writing can be used for that. When making important decisions, write down everyone's opinions. When presenting the decision, include the different factors and considerations. This way the whole team will feel like their opinion was heard, even if a different direction was taken.

# Knowledge Base
Last but not least, everything written may be useful for newcomers. Writing specifically for their on-boarding is not ideal because it usually results with text that only describes the way things are at present. It leaves out all of the important factors and reasoning.

When an organization has a habit of writing as a tool for it's primary processes, the written result naturally contains the most important and interesting details. These details will be important for future decision making as they were important for the decision making in the past.

One of the problems with most knowledge bases is that as time goes on, their structure get's too complicated. At some point, the written information is lost in the complexity of the structure.

Although this can be alleviated by preserving structure, in the very near future I think this will be less of a problem. As LLMs (large language models) like ChatGPT will be further integrated into knowledge base products, we will be able to query the knowledge base with human language. At that point, when something will be unclear, the knowledge base will be able to give useful answers based on past writing and about past thinking as a result.

# Conclusion
Although it is often overlooked, writing is beneficial on a personal and organizational level. Writing is a tool for thinking, collaborating and creating a digital knowledge base. In the very near future, the written content will come to life and improve the very important work that we do.
